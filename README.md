# 5G Network 
In the "scripts" directory, you will find seven files used for automating 5G network tests. These files include two bash scripts that generate log files for iperf3 and ping tests, and a separate bash script that prevents the gNBs from shutting down. Additionally, there are four python scripts available in this folder two aimed at sending AT commands from the UE side, one which extract valuable network information while the other establishes connections. We also have a python script for iperf3, but it's more sophisticated than the previous one and provides more data. Lastly, the last python file is designed to enable users to run the previous scripts for measuring network performance. 

In the Data analysis you have a Jupyter notebook file. In this file I do some data visualization of the output I've got from my 5G indoor network testing.
However, please note that this work is still in progress and may be subject to changes in the future.
